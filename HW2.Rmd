a) 
In the neoclassical economics theory the number of participant having received either a mug or a pen should have had the same proportion for the willingness to exchange. Another aspect is that under the neoclassical economics, individual are "rational" thereby they make decision based on maximization of their utility, thereby the percentage of individual choosing to exchange their goods should have far exceed what was found in this study due to the monetary increased added to the goods swap.

Standard utility function (Koszegi and Rabin 2006): 

$$u(c|r) = m(c) + n(c|r)$$
Where:
c = consumption of goods (can be k dimensional);
m(c) = utility derieved by consumption of goods;
n(c|r) = gain-loss utility

In our case:
$$(4c1+4c2+c3)+(v(4c1-r1)+v(4c2-r2)+v(c3-r3))$$
$$ v(x) = \begin{cases} x\space for\space x > 0 \\ 3x \space for\space x <0 \end{cases} $$
Where:
$C = (4c1+4c2+c3)$;
$m(c,w) = (4c1+4c2+c3)+w $
$n(c|r) = (v(4c1-r1)+v(4c2-r2)+v(c3-r3))$

- mugs  : Dimension 1 ; ouctome c1 ; reference r1
- pens  : Dimension 2 ; outcome c2 ; reference r2
- money : Dimension 3 ; outcome c3 ; reference r3

Let's imagine a situation where the agent owns a mug and do not expect to sell it, his reference point will be $(r1,r3) = (1,0)$,
on the other hand in a situation for an agent who neither own nor wants to acquire a mugs while a reference point of $(r1,r3) = (0,0)$. We now can estimate at which compensation price $p^s$ our agent would be indifferent in between changing his mug or not.

$$u((1,0,0)|(1,0,0)) = m = 4(1)+0 = 4$$
$$u(swap|(1,0) = mc1(0) + mc3(p^s) + v(mc1(0) - mc(1)) + v(mc3(p^s)-mc(0) \\ = 4(0) + p^s + 3[4(0)-4(1)]+p^s \\ = 2p^s -12$$
$$u(no\space swap|(1,0)) =u(swap|(1,0) \\ 4 = -12 + 2p^s \\ p^s = 8$$
Now lets take a look at an agent who does not own a mug nor does expect to acquire own.
$$u(no\space swap|(0,0)) = mc1(0) + mc3(0) = 4(0) + 0 = 0$$
$$u(swap|(0,0) = mc1(1) + mc3(-p^b + v(mc1(1) - mc1(0)) + v(mc3(-p^b)-mc3(0)\\ = 4(1)-p^b1+(4(1)-0)+3[-p^b-0] \\ = 8 - 4p^b \\ p^b = 4$$ 
Because mugs and pens are equal in initial value: $4c1 = 4c2\space;c1 = c2$ We don't need to redo the experience with pens. In this situation we can see that the perceived value of the mug is 2 times higher for the agent owning, this situation is in coherence with the principle of loss aversion. Thereby we can conclude than the formulation provide does capture loss aversion in agents. However this situation is only the case if the initial reference point is "not expected to swap". 
This models also capture diminishing sensitivity (the sensitivity decreased as value of the monetary gains increased). In the example above the monetary gains use was equal to 1 and the ration gain/loss was 2. With a the monetary compensation of 5 cents:
$p^s = 160\space and\space p^b = 40$
The increases in ratio is in coherence with diminishing sensitivity.

prove that pmin < p < pmax

a)
$$Pr(s_{i} \geqq max\space j \neq i\space  s_{j}) = \int\space \prod j\neq\space i[G(p_{j}-p_{i}+\theta_{i}]g(\theta_{i})d\theta_{i}$$
b)
The expected demand is 
$$Q_{i(p^{*}) = Pr(s_{i} \geqq \space max_{j\neq\space i}S_{j})L}$$
Then the profit is equal to 
$$\pi(p^{*} = (p^{*}-c)Q_{i}(p^{*})$$
This function can be  differentiate by pi and gives the marginal revenu equal to the marginal cost
$$p_{i} = c_{i}-\frac{Q_{i}(p^{*})}{\partial Q_{i}/\partial p_{i}}$$

a)
If the social cost for a firm is at 0, then it become socially efficent for the add-on to be consumed, however, 

d)
In a situation where alpha is close to 1, we assume that the market is full of naive consumer. In such scenario, (Gabaix and Libson 2005), explains that a myope consumer will be unaware of add-on unless they are showed a listing price for it (ex. advertising). In such scenario, Those consumers will take all the steps needed to avoid paying for the company advertisign price. This situation will thus, diminish the company profits. Thereby, the best strategy would be to propose a lower based good price.

e)
In a situation where alpha is close to 0, the population is full of sophisticated consumers.(Gabaix and Libson 2005), explains that in such scenario, a company that wishes to maximize its profit should propose a high quality product at a high biase price with a lower add-on price.
